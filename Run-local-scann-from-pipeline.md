SonarQube can be integrated with GitLab CI/CD pipelines to analyze your code. Since you’ve registered your developer’s Windows PC as a GitLab Runner, the analysis will typically run on the local copy of the code on the runner machine (your D drive), assuming the pipeline pulls or accesses the code from there.

Here's a step-by-step guide to set up and run a GitLab pipeline for SonarQube code analysis:

---

### 1. **SonarQube and GitLab Integration Setup**
- Ensure SonarQube is up and running, either locally, on a server, or in a container.
- Obtain the SonarQube authentication token:
  - Go to **SonarQube** > **User Account** > **My Account** > **Security** and generate a token.

---

### 2. **Install SonarScanner on Your Runner**
SonarScanner is the tool used to scan your code.

1. Download the **SonarScanner CLI** for Windows from the [official site](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/).
2. Extract it to a directory on your PC, e.g., `C:\SonarScanner`.
3. Add the `bin` directory of SonarScanner to your system `PATH` environment variable.

### 3. **Configure GitLab CI/CD**
Create or update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your GitLab repository to include a SonarQube scanning job. Example configuration:

```yaml
stages:
  - scan

sonarqube_scan:
  stage: scan
  tags:
    - windows-runner
  script:
    - 'echo "Running SonarQube scan..."'
    - sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=my_project_key \
                    -Dsonar.sources=D:/path_to_your_code \
                    -Dsonar.host.url=http://your-sonarqube-server-url \
                    -Dsonar.login=your_sonarqube_token
```

### 4. **Important Points**
- **Does SonarQube Scan Local Code or GitLab Repo?**
  - The code analyzed by SonarQube depends on where the pipeline executes:
    - **Local Runner (Windows PC):** Scans the code on your PC’s D drive (e.g., `D:/path_to_your_code`).
    - **Shared/GitLab Runner:** Pulls the code from the GitLab repository and scans it.

- **Custom Configuration for Local Code:**
  If you want to scan code directly on the D drive, ensure:
  - The `-Dsonar.sources` parameter points to the correct directory (e.g., `D:/path_to_your_code`).
  - The `.gitlab-ci.yml` job is tagged for your Windows runner (`tags: - windows-runner`).

- **Pipeline Trigger:**
  When you push changes to GitLab, the pipeline triggers the SonarQube scan using your runner.

---

### 5. **Running the Pipeline**
1. Push your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to GitLab.
2. Trigger the pipeline by pushing any code changes or manually running the pipeline from the GitLab CI/CD section.

---

### 6. **Verify Results**
- After the pipeline completes:
  - Check the pipeline logs in GitLab for the SonarQube job output.
  - Visit your SonarQube server and view the project’s dashboard for detailed analysis.

---

If your use case is to always scan local code and not rely on GitLab's repository copy, ensure your runner has direct access to the D drive and the paths are properly configured in your pipeline.
